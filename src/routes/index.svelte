<h2>Hi</h2>
<p class="pb-4">
  Smelte is
  <a class="a" href="https://vuetifyjs.com">Vuetify</a>
  inspired collection of
  <a class="a" href="https://material.io/">Material design</a>
  components for Svelte built with
  <a class="a" href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>
  . There's only a handful of components at the moment but this project is aimed
  to grow into a powerful UI framework like Vuetify but keeping minimal bundle
  size thanks to Svelte and Purge CSS.
</p>

<p>
  Tailwind resets much of CSS whereas Smelte tries to bring sensible Material
  design defaults in
  <a class="a" href="/typography">typography</a>
  and
  <a class="a" href="/colors">color</a>.
